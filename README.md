# CannyEdgeDetector
Canny Edge Detector from scratch using Python.Without using OpenCV libs.
## Step by Step 
Firstly we apply Gaussian Filter to reducing noises. Then we
get the edge gradient magnitudes and directions with the help of Sobel Filter. The edges gets
more thiner. The reduntant edges, noises are eliminated. In the below, the steps will be
examined with details. Before the steps, the image should be grayscaled.
